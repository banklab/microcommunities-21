# Sabrinas-microcommunities / Bachelor Project
## First Data
### Original Data
Contains Data and R Code that was used to solve the fist Steps (see R Notebook ''Step-by-step.Rmd'' for more Information on the Steps)

- allSNPs_w_gene_position.tsv *data of all SNPs*

- alltogether_modified.gen.fasta.gen *DNA sequence off all data*

- alltogether_modified.lst.txt *Protein name with start/end*

- alltogether_modified.prt *AA sequence off all data*

- FixedMutations_over_time.pdf *Plot*

- FixedMutation_over_time_Mado.pdf *plot*

- FixedMutations_OverTime.txt *41 fixed SNP positions*

### Results
Contains .csv files that were output of ”Step–by–step–final–version.Rmd”, .xlsx where the .csv are in an excel table.

- Function_of_Proteins.pdf *Here we have a list of the proteins belonging to the SNPs with more information.*

- Pos_AA.csv & Pos_AA.xlsx *The aminoacid sequence to the proteins are listed*

- Pos_DNA.csv & Pos_DNA.xlsx *The nucleotide sequence to the proteins are listed*

- Result.xlsx *all tables in one file*

- Result_sorted.csv & Result_sorted.xlsx *The proteins belonging to the SNPs are listed*

### VSC manipulations

Files where I had to change something manually to add the file into R are stored here.

- allSNPs_w_gene_position_spaced.tsv *data of all SNPs*

- aalltogether_modified.gen.fasta – Kopie.txt *DNA sequences belonging to the SNPs ofAGTU.c01*

- alltogether_modified.gen.fasta – not nicely.gen *DNA sequences belonging to the SNPs*

- alltogether_modified.gen.fasta.AGTU.gen *DNA sequences belonging to the SNPs ofAGTU.c01 but nicer spaced*

- alltogether_modified.gen.fasta_spaced.gen *DNA sequence off all data*

- alltogether_modified.lst_spaced.txt *Protein name with start/end*

- alltogether_modified_spaced.prt *AA sequence off all data*

### Other Files

Files that are stored in the folder not belonging to another folder.

- By Hand.xlsx *Counted the nucleotides by hand to find the SNP reference from the gen.fasta data.*

- Confusion.xlsx *Excel table of not nicely search for the reference nucleotide from the gen.fasta data for the SNPs.*

- Step–by–step.Rmd *Code where I have everything in there (all trials done manually or with only little data).*
- Step–by–step–final–version.Rmd *This code can be used to solve the first Steps.*



## Infos

Contains documents that have an informational purpose.

- Introduction paper.pdf *The first paper Mado gave me, that explains a lot about my data and why I do this project.*
- Meetings.docx *Notes from meetings with Mado*
- Presentation in Labmeeting 23.09. (Mado).pptx *PPP from Mado about her talk in the Labmeeting*


## Papers

Contains papers that could be useful.

- N.Surname_Year_Title.pdf

- P. Piccardi_2019_Toxicity drives facilitation between 4 bacterial species.pdf
